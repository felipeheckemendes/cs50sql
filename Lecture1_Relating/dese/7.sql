-- DESE is preparing a report on schools in the Cambridge school district. 
-- In 7.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) in the Cambridge school district.
-- Keep in mind that Cambridge, the city, contains a few school districts, but DESE is interested in the district whose name is “Cambridge.”
