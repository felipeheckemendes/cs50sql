-- 5.sql
-- DESE would like you to determine in what cities additional public schools might be needed. 
-- In 5.sql, write a SQL query to find cities with 3 or fewer public schools.
-- Your query should return the names of the cities and the number of public schools within them, ordered from greatest number of public schools to least.
-- If two cities have the same number of public schools, order them alphabetically.
-- 

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number of public schools", "city"
FROM "schools"
WHERE "type"= 'Public School'
GROUP BY "city"
HAVING COUNT(*) <= 3
ORDER BY "Number of public schools" DESC, "city"
;
